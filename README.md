# Cartel

Performance so good it should be a crime.

## Description

_At the moment, 1.21 is broken. Don't fret, it's just because there is so much broken mod stuff rn. It will come in time_

Cartel is a Minecraft optimization mod pack centered on bringing next-generation performance without sacrificing QoL features from popular optimization mods such as OptiFine. Utilizing powerful mods such as Sodium, FerriteCore, etc allows you to run Minecraft almost _illegally_ good.

## Versions

Cartel comes in a multitude a versions for every play style. The three I maintain are:

- **Vanilla**, which maintains the vanilla feel/features with only the performance increases.
- **Enhanced**, which adds extra QoL features that allows a more _OptFine_-like feel for those who want those features.
- **Advanced**, which adds those QoL features + a bit more that would normally be outside the scope of a performance pack (like AppleSkin, etc) to bring your gameplay to the next level.
