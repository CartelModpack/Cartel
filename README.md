Cartel
========

Performance so good it should be a crime. 

Description
--------------

Cartel is a Minecraft optimization mod pack centered on bringing next-generation performance without sacrificing QoL features from popular optimization mods such as OptiFine. Utilizing powerful mods such as Sodium, FerriteCore, etc allows you to run Minecraft almost *illegally* good

Versions
-----------

The **Lite**, **Normal**, and **Plus** versions of Cartel do not refer to any sort of pricing, but more the type of features contained within. This is because of the different playstyles that each player has. **Lite** is a more vanilla experience, **Normal** is most similar to OptiFine, and **Plus** has a few extra features beyond optimizations and QoL.
