## v1.1.0-pre1: The Almost 1.20.6 Update

Due to the changes with the Mixin system in the new version of Minecraft and Fabric, many mods have been removed temporarily until they are patched for the new setup. I just wanted to have a *version* out for people to use. All removals are listed below, some of which break OptiFine compatibility and remove a few performance features.
